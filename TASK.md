### Project Scenario: Building a Python Web Scraper with Git and GitHub

 

### Team-Based Task Allocation

 

#### Team Structure and Roles:

- **Team Lead**: Oversees the project, coordinates between members, and ensures timelines are met.

- **Developer 1**: Focuses on initial setup, basic script writing, and core functionality.

- **Developer 2**: Handles branching, merging, and implementing additional features.

- **Developer 3**: Manages collaboration, pull requests, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

 

### Step-by-Step Tasks

 

#### Step 1: Project Setup and Introduction to Git

**Team Lead**:

- **Objective**: Set up the project repository and ensure everyone understands the basics of Git.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a new directory for the project and initialize a Git repository.

  2. Set up the Git username and email for the team.

  3. Create and commit a `README.md` file.

 

**Commands**:

```bash

mkdir web-scraper

cd web-scraper

git init

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email you@example.com

echo "# Web Scraper Project" > README.md

git add README.md

git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

```

 

#### Step 2: Writing the Initial Python Script

**Developer 1**:

- **Objective**: Write a basic Python script for the web scraper.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a Python script that scrapes data from a website.

  2. Stage and commit the script.

 

**Commands**:

```python

# scraper.py

import requests

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

 

url = 'http://example.com'

response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

 

print(soup.title.text)

```

 

```bash

git add scraper.py

git commit -m "Add initial web scraper script"

```

 

#### Step 3: Creating and Managing Branches

**Developer 2**:

- **Objective**: Implement branching and merging for feature development.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a new branch to add a feature for saving data to a CSV file.

  2. Modify the script, stage, and commit changes.

  3. Merge the branch into the main branch.

 

**Commands**:

```bash

git checkout -b save-to-csv

 

# Modify scraper.py

import csv

 

with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:

    writer = csv.writer(file)

    writer.writerow(["Title"])

    writer.writerow([soup.title.text])

 

git add scraper.py

git commit -m "Add feature to save data to CSV"

git checkout main

git merge save-to-csv

```

 

#### Step 4: Collaborating with GitHub

**Developer 3**:

- **Objective**: Push the repository to GitHub and manage collaboration.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a repository on GitHub.

  2. Add the remote URL and push the repository.

  3. Invite collaborators and ensure team members can access the repository.

 

**Commands**:

```bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/web-scraper.git

git push -u origin main

```

 

#### Step 5: Implementing and Reviewing Pull Requests

**Developer 2**:

- **Objective**: Create and manage pull requests.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a new branch to add a feature for scraping additional data.

  2. Modify the script, commit, and push the changes.

  3. Create and manage pull requests on GitHub.

 

**Commands**:

```bash

git checkout -b scrape-additional-data

 

# Modify scraper.py to scrape additional data

additional_data = soup.find_all('p')

for data in additional_data:

    writer.writerow([data.text])

 

git add scraper.py

git commit -m "Add feature to scrape additional data"

git push origin scrape-additional-data

```

 

#### Step 6: Understanding Git Internals

**Team Lead**:

- **Objective**: Ensure the team understands Git's internal workings.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Explore the `.git` directory.

  2. Understand Git objects, commits, blobs, trees, and how Git stores changes.

  3. Demonstrate low-level Git commands.

 

**Commands**:

```bash

cd .git

ls -a

 

git cat-file -p HEAD

git hash-object -w scraper.py

git cat-file -t <object-hash>

git cat-file -p <object-hash>

```

 

#### Step 7: Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions

**Developer 3**:

- **Objective**: Set up and manage CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing.

  2. Push the workflow to GitHub and ensure it runs correctly.

 

**Commands**:

```yaml

# .github/workflows/python-app.yml

name: Python application

 

on: [push]

 

jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 

    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python

      uses: actions/setup-python@v2

      with:

        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies

      run: |

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip

        pip install requests beautifulsoup4

    - name: Run tests

      run: |

        python -m unittest discover

```

 

#### Step 8: Continuous Learning and Best Practices

**All Team Members**:

- **Objective**: Continue improving Git skills and following best practices.

- **Tasks**:

  1. Explore advanced Git workflows and best practices.

  2. Practice writing good commit messages.

  3. Utilize Git tools and resources, join communities, and contribute to open-source projects.

 

### Summary

By dividing the project into specific tasks and roles, team members can focus on different aspects of the project while learning both Git and GitHub in depth. Regular meetings and updates will ensure the project progresses smoothly and knowledge is shared across the team.
